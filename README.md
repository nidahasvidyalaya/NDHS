1. Introduction

Nidahas Vidyalaya is a fully online academy based in Sri Lanka, open to learners worldwide. Its aim is to provide structured, high‑quality online education while keeping direct fiat costs for students as low as possible.

To support this, Nidahas Vidyalaya uses a blockchain‑based token called NDHS, issued on the Stellar network. NDHS is a fixed‑supply service token that students can use to obtain educational services.

In this model:

Students send NDHS to Nidahas Vidyalaya.

Nidahas Vidyalaya provides educational services whose value is based on the current market value of NDHS on Stellar and an internal price list for services.

NDHS is not legal tender and not an investment product. It is a digital instrument accepted by Nidahas Vidyalaya in exchange for its own services.

Nidahas Vidyalaya operates from Sri Lanka and is mindful of the position of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) regarding virtual currencies. It therefore does not encourage students to convert Sri Lankan rupees or other fiat currency into cryptoassets. Instead, students are encouraged, where lawful, to rely on free or reward‑based sources of cryptocurrency, convert those to XLM, and then to NDHS.

The academy focuses on:

Clear, structured online courses.

Live and recorded sessions where possible.

Educational content that is accessible to Sri Lankan and international students.

The word “Nidahas” reflects a commitment to reducing financial barriers to learning while maintaining a sustainable model for teacher time and infrastructure.

3. NDHS Token

3.1 Technical details

NDHS is issued as a custom asset on the Stellar blockchain:

Asset code: NDHS

Issuer / Receiving address: GB5PSHP5D4IWUZK7LBLGUSIVX22UKLAIL3UEZFH35WRNNT22TN3RYNP7

Total supply: 10,000,000 NDHS (fixed)

No further tokens will be issued.

Token metadata, including description and logo, is published via a Stellar TOML file at https://nidahasvidyalaya.edu.lk/.well-known/stellar.toml.

3.2 Purpose

NDHS is a service token used only within Nidahas Vidyalaya. Students transfer NDHS to Nidahas Vidyalaya and receive educational services in return.

NDHS:

Does not function as currency.

Does not represent a share or ownership interest.

Does not guarantee any right to fiat redemption.

Any market price that NDHS has on Stellar arises from independent trading and is not controlled by Nidahas Vidyalaya.

4. Using NDHS for Educational Services

4.1 Service exchange mechanism

When a student wishes to use NDHS:

The student searches the token, adds trustline and holds NDHS in a Stellar wallet.

The student sends an agreed amount of NDHS to the issuer address of Nidahas Vidyalaya.

Nidahas Vidyalaya confirms receipt.

Nidahas Vidyalaya checks the current indicative market value of NDHS on Stellar DEX interfaces (for example, in XLM).

Nidahas Vidyalaya applies its internal service price list and informs the student what services this NDHS transfer covers.

Services are scheduled and delivered.

The internal price list may include items such as:

Enrolment in a specific course.

A defined number of live class hours.

Access to particular learning resources.

The exact list and pricing will be maintained on the Nidahas Vidyalaya website and updated when needed.

4.2 Variable NDHS requirements

Because the market value of NDHS can go up or down:

The NDHS amount required for a given service may change over time.

The value of a student’s NDHS transfer is assessed at the time of transfer, not at any earlier or later price.
Nidahas Vidyalaya does not guarantee any fixed or long‑term rate between NDHS and any other asset. Students receive services only, not money.

4.3 No fiat redemption

Nidahas Vidyalaya:

Does not buy back NDHS for Sri Lankan rupees or other fiat currency.

Does not run a currency exchange or money transfer service.

NDHS can be used to access educational services from Nidahas Vidyalaya. That is its sole intended function.

5. Obtaining NDHS

5.1 Principle

Because this project is based in Sri Lanka and CBSL has warned about risks of virtual currencies, Nidahas Vidyalaya does not encourage students to convert Sri Lankan rupees or other fiat savings into cryptoassets.

Students who choose to obtain NDHS are encouraged, where lawful in their jurisdiction, to do so using external free or reward‑based sources of cryptocurrency.

5.2 Suggested path

A typical path for a student might be:

Acquire free cryptocurrency.

Obtain small amounts from reputable faucets, legitimate airdrops or learning and contribution reward schemes.

Convert to XLM.

Use external exchange or swap services to convert those free assets into XLM (Stellar Lumens).

Buy NDHS.

Add NDHS as a custom asset in a Stellar wallet using asset code NDHS and issuer address GB5PSHP5D4IWUZK7LBLGUSIVX22UKLAIL3UEZFH35WRNNT22TN3RYNP7, then use XLM to purchase NDHS on Stellar decentralised exchanges, if liquidity is available.

Use NDHS with Nidahas Vidyalaya.

Send NDHS to Nidahas Vidyalaya as described in Section 4 to obtain educational services.

These steps are suggestions, not requirements. Nidahas Vidyalaya does not operate or control any faucet, airdrop provider or exchange.

5.3 Airdrops by Nidahas Vidyalaya

Nidahas Vidyalaya may occasionally distribute NDHS directly to stakeholders, at its discretion, for example to:

Support building trustline, transferring ownership, or holding asset

Support new learners.

Reward course completion or consistent engagement.

Any such airdrops will be announced on the official website. They are not guaranteed and should not be relied upon.

6. Ecosystem Direction

Initially, NDHS is accepted only by Nidahas Vidyalaya. Future possibilities, subject to law and capacity, include:

Independent tutors accepting NDHS for teaching through Nidahas Vidyalaya.

Content creators being rewarded in NDHS.

Stakeholders being rewarded in NDHS.

NDHS‑funded scholarship pools managed transparently.

Nidahas Vidyalaya may also explore non‑monetary uses of blockchain, such as issuing on‑chain records of course completion.

These ideas are exploratory and will only be implemented if they align with regulation and the educational mission.

7. Regulatory Context

7.1 Nature of NDHS

NDHS is designed as a token that:

Is used to obtain services from Nidahas Vidyalaya.

Is not legal tender.

Is not a savings product, security or deposit.

Does not carry rights to profits, interest or dividends.

Secondary trading on Stellar is separate from Nidahas Vidyalaya’s operations.

7.2 Central Bank of Sri Lanka

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has warned the public about risks associated with virtual currencies and unregulated financial schemes. Nidahas Vidyalaya:

Does not promote NDHS as an investment.

Does not offer any guaranteed return.

Does not provide exchange services between NDHS and fiat.

Students are responsible for checking that their activities with cryptoassets are permitted under the laws and regulations that apply to them.

7.3 User responsibility

Each user must:

Understand the risks of cryptoassets and the possibility of loss.

Secure their wallets and private keys.

Seek professional legal or financial advice if unsure about their position.

This document does not provide legal, tax, financial or investment advice.

8. Risks

Key risks include:

Price and liquidity risk: NDHS markets on Stellar, if any, may be illiquid and volatile.

Service risk: Course offerings, scheduling and capacity may change over time.

Technical risk: Problems with Stellar, wallets or internet connectivity can affect token transfers and service access.

Regulatory risk: Future regulation may affect how NDHS and similar tokens can be used.

Security risk: Loss of keys or successful phishing can lead to permanent loss of NDHS.

Students should only use NDHS if they understand and accept these risks.

9. Conclusion

Nidahas Vidyalaya uses NDHS as a simple, blockchain‑based way for students to obtain online educational services:

Students send NDHS.

Nidahas Vidyalaya provides services, valued at the time of transfer using market information and an internal price list.

NDHS is a service token, not money or an investment. The model is designed with the Sri Lankan context in mind, particularly by:

Avoiding encouragement of fiat‑to‑crypto conversion.

Encouraging the use of free and reward‑based crypto sources where legal.

Nidahas Vidyalaya will refine this model over time. Updated information will always be available at:
